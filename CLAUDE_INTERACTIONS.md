## Conversation Log — 2026-03-03

### User Prompt 1
> Create a 45 minute presentation about getting started in HAM Radio in 2026. Use marp.app files for the presentation. Use several MARP text files to make it easy for the presentation to have parts swapped in and out & order changed. Cover the progression from listening with RTL-SDR, unlicensed activities like MeshCore and FRS, then GMRS, and the three levels of HAM licenses: technician, general, and extra. Cover digital ham radio modes: DMR, D-STAR, C4FM, and M-17. Cover inovative organizations like ARDC, Zero Retries, EtherHam, Random Wire, Ham Radio Crash Course. Cover activities like POTA, ARES, and field day. Cover modes like phone, FM, SSB, FT8, VARA, FreeDV, etc.

**Claude Response:** Created a full modular Marp presentation suite in the `slides/` directory — 10 individual `.md` files, a `combine.sh` script, and a `README.md`. See below for file list.

### User Prompt 2
> In a markdown file record the prompts I put in and the rest of our conversation. Always do this for anything in this folder.

**Claude Response:** Updated `CLAUDE_INTERACTIONS.md` to record all prompts and responses. Saved project preference to memory.

### User Prompt 3
> Great! Add the URL of the git hub repo to the first slide. https://github.com/payne/goHAM2026

**Claude Response:** Added `github.com/payne/goHAM2026` as a code-formatted line below the callsign/date on the title slide in `slides/00_title.md`. Rebuilt `combined.md`.

### User Prompt 4
> Add github automation so that anytime a change is pushed to one of the MARP source files, the presentation is rebuilt. Keep the presentation in both combined.html and index.html

**Claude Response:** Created `.github/workflows/build-presentation.yml` — triggers on push to main/master when `slides/**` or `combine.sh` changes, runs combine.sh + marp-cli, commits `combined.html` and `index.html` back to the repo. Added `.gitignore`. Updated README with GitHub Pages setup instructions.

### User Prompt 5
> Slide 7 (and others) have tables where every other row has a white background. Improve the contrast of the text in these rows.

**Claude Response:** Added `background: #0f172a; color: #e2e8f0;` to the `td` CSS rule in all 10 slide files. The odd rows (which had no explicit background, defaulting to white) now match the dark page background. Even rows remain `#1e293b` for subtle striping. Rebuilt `combined.md`.

### User Prompt 6
> Many of the slides have content near the bottom that is cut off. Fix this. It's ok to have more slides. Avoid having slides with content we can not read at the bottom.

**Claude Response:** Split 9 overflowing slides across 7 files. New slides added:
- `01_rtlsdr`: "Getting Started" → split off "RTL-SDR: Tips & Tricks"
- `04_licensing`: "Technician License" → split off "Technician Exam: What You'll Study"; "How to Get Licensed" → split off "Taking the Exam"
- `05_analog_modes`: "FT8" → split off "FT8: Why It Changed Everything"; "JS8Call/APRS" → split off "More Digital Data Modes"
- `06_digital_voice`: "D-STAR" → split off "D-STAR: Ecosystem & Community"
- `07_organizations`: "HRCC" → split off "More Ham Radio on YouTube"
- `08_activities`: "ARES" → split off "ARES: Training & Technology"; "More Activities" → split off "More Activities: Satellites & Weak Signal"
- `09_conclusion`: "Starter Playbook" → split off "After You're Licensed"
Total slides grew from ~60 to ~70. Rebuilt `combined.md`.

Pushed. Here's a summary of what was split:

| File | Original slide | New slide |
|---|---|---|
| `01_rtlsdr` | Getting Started with RTL-SDR | **RTL-SDR: Tips & Tricks** |
| `04_licensing` | Technician License | **Technician Exam: What You'll Study** (table) |
| `04_licensing` | How to Get Licensed | **Taking the Exam** |
| `05_analog_modes` | FT8 — The Digital Phenomenon | **FT8: Why It Changed Everything** |
| `05_analog_modes` | JS8Call, APRS & Weak Signal | **More Digital Data Modes** (+ chooser table) |
| `06_digital_voice` | D-STAR | **D-STAR: Ecosystem & Community** |
| `07_organizations` | Ham Radio Crash Course | **More Ham Radio on YouTube** (table) |
| `08_activities` | ARES | **ARES: Training & Technology** |
| `08_activities` | More Activities | **More Activities: Satellites & Weak Signal** |
| `09_conclusion` | The Starter Playbook | **After You're Licensed** |

Deck grew from ~60 to ~70 slides. GitHub Actions will rebuild the HTML automatically.

### User Prompt 7
> Slides 19, 25 and others still have content being cut off on the bottom — fix that. Add the date & time the deck was last built to the first slide.

**Claude Response:** Identified slides 19 ("GMRS → HAM: The Bridge") and 25 ("Extra License") plus 6 more overflowing slides. Split all 8 and added build timestamp:
- `03_gmrs`: GMRS→HAM → "Skills That Transfer" + "GMRS vs. HAM Technician" (table only)
- `04_licensing`: Extra License → + "Extra License: The Challenge"
- `05_analog_modes`: FM → + "FM: Getting Started"; SSB → + "SSB: Equipment"
- `06_digital_voice`: DMR → + "DMR: Hardware & Getting Started"; C4FM → + "C4FM: Why It Works"
- `07_organizations`: Zero Retries → + "Zero Retries: Why Subscribe"; EtherHam → + "EtherHam: Finding the Community"
- Added `*Built: BUILD_TIMESTAMP*` placeholder to title slide; workflow injects UTC date+time via `sed` after combine.sh but before marp-cli. Slide count: ~70 → ~78.

## Claude [2026-03-04 08:29:08]

Pushed. Here's a summary:

**8 more slides split** (19 total splits across this session):
| File | Split |
|---|---|
| `03_gmrs` | GMRS→HAM → skills + comparison table |
| `04_licensing` | Extra License → privileges + challenge/study |
| `05_analog_modes` | FM → starter mode + getting started; SSB → physics/why + equipment |
| `06_digital_voice` | DMR → origins/networks + hardware/setup; C4FM → what is + why it works |
| `07_organizations` | Zero Retries → what is + why subscribe; EtherHam → what is + finding community |

**Build timestamp:** Title slide now shows `*Built: BUILD_TIMESTAMP*`. When GitHub Actions runs, it replaces that with the actual UTC time (e.g., `2026-03-04 14:32 UTC`) before rendering the HTML. The local `combined.md` keeps the literal placeholder — the timestamp only appears in the rendered `combined.html`/`index.html`.

The "Decoders & add-ons" content is now on its own slide. The original overflow slide has been split into:
- **Slide 8:** SDR Software in 2026 (SDR++ + Other options)
- **New slide 9:** SDR Software: Decoders & Add-ons

Run `npx @marp-team/marp-cli combined.md --html -o presentation.html` to render and verify.
